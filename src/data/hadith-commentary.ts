      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Importance of Intention (Niyyah)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This hadith is considered one of the most comprehensive sayings of the Prophet (SAW). Imam Ash-Shafi'i said it constitutes one-third of knowledge because actions are related to the heart, tongue, and limbs, and the intention is the action of the heart.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Key Lessons:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>The validity of any deed depends on the intention behind it.</li>
        <li>A good deed done for showing off (Riya) is rejected.</li>
        <li>Permissible acts (like eating or sleeping) can become worship if done with the intention to gain strength for serving Allah.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Hadith of Jibreel (AS)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This hadith explains the three levels of the religion: Islam (outward actions), Iman (inward beliefs), and Ihsan (excellence/spiritual perfection).</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Islam:</strong> The Five Pillars (Shahada, Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj).</li>
        <li><strong>Iman:</strong> Belief in Allah, Angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, and Destiny (Qadar).</li>
        <li><strong>Ihsan:</strong> To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot, knowing He sees you.</li>
      </ul>
    `,
    3: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Pillars of Islam</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Ibn Umar (RA) narrates that Islam is built on five pillars. This imagery suggests that Islam is like a structure or a tent that cannot stand without these supporting pillars.</p>
      <p>While the Shahada is the foundation, Salah is the central pillar. Zakah, Hajj, and Fasting provide the structural integrity needed for a complete believer.</p>
    `,
    4: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Stages of Creation & Decree</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This hadith details the development of the fetus in the womb (40 days as a drop, 40 as a clot, 40 as a lump of flesh) before the soul is breathed into it.</p>
      <p><strong>The Decree:</strong> The angel writes down four things: provision, lifespan, deeds, and whether the person will be wretched or happy. This emphasizes belief in Qadar (Destiny) while maintaining that humans must strive to do good deeds.</p>
    `,
    5: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Rejection of Innovation (Bid'ah)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This is a primary principle in protecting the religion from corruption. Any act of worship not rooted in the Quran or Sunnah is rejected.</p>
      <p>Scholars distinguish between linguistic innovation (new inventions like cars) which is permissible, and religious innovation (new rituals) which is forbidden.</p>
    `,
    6: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Halal and Haram are Clear</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear. Between them are doubtful matters (Mutashabihat). Protecting oneself from these doubts preserves one's religion and honor.</p>
      <p><strong>The Heart:</strong> The Prophet (SAW) highlights that the heart is the control center. If it is sound (pure from diseases like envy and arrogance), the whole body acts righteously.</p>
    `,
    7: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Religion is Sincerity (Naseehah)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Naseehah is often translated as "advice," but it implies "sincerity" or "wanting good" for others.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>To Allah:</strong> Believing in Him and obeying Him.</li>
        <li><strong>To His Book:</strong> Reading and practicing the Quran.</li>
        <li><strong>To His Messenger:</strong> Following the Sunnah.</li>
        <li><strong>To the Leaders:</strong> Obeying them in good and advising them gently.</li>
        <li><strong>To the Common Folk:</strong> Guiding them and not harming them.</li>
      </ul>
    `,
    8: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Sanctity of a Muslim</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">A person's life and property are sacred once they declare the Shahada and establish prayer/zakah, unless they commit a crime punishable by law (e.g., murder). Only Allah judges their inner sincerity.</p>
    `,
    9: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Ease in Obligation</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"What I have forbidden, avoid; what I have commanded, do as much of it as you can."</p>
      <p>This shows the mercy of Islam. Prohibitions must be avoided completely (unless under dire necessity), but commands (like standing in prayer) are conditional on ability.</p>
    `,
    10: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Pure Sustenance & Accepted Dua</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Allah is Pure and accepts only what is pure. Consuming Halal (lawful) food is a prerequisite for having one's prayers (Dua) answered.</p>
      <p>The hadith mentions a traveler (who usually has dual acceptance) whose dua is rejected because his food and clothing are from haram sources.</p>
    `,
    11: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Leaving Doubt for Certainty</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt."</p>
      <p>This provides a psychological comfort (Wara'). If a believer is unsure whether an action is permissible or not, avoiding it brings peace of heart. Truth brings tranquility, while falsehood brings doubt.</p>
    `,
    12: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Focusing on What Matters</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Part of the perfection of one's Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him."</p>
      <p>This teaches time management and focus. A Muslim should not waste time on gossip, excessive entertainment, or meddling in others' affairs. Instead, focus on what benefits your Dunya and Akhirah.</p>
    `,
    13: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Complete Faith</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."</p>
      <p>This negates the perfection of faith (not the root of faith) for those who are selfish. It encourages a heart free of jealousy (Hasad) and wanting good for the entire community.</p>
    `,
    14: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Sanctity of Blood</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The blood of a Muslim cannot be shed except in three cases: adultery by a married person, a life for a life (retribution), and apostasy (leaving the religion and opposing the community).</p>
      <p>This emphasizes that life is sacred and cannot be taken by vigilante justice; legal punishments are the domain of the state/judge only.</p>
    `,
    15: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Good Speech and Neighbors</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent."</p>
      <p>This hadith links social manners to Aqeedah (belief). Silence is better than backbiting or idle talk. It also commands honoring the neighbor and the guest.</p>
    `,
    16: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Control Your Anger</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">A man asked for advice, and the Prophet (SAW) repeated: "Do not become angry."</p>
      <p>This does not mean one never feels anger (which is natural), but rather: do not <em>act</em> on anger. Control your tongue and hand. Anger is from Shaitan, and controlling it is a sign of true strength.</p>
    `,
    17: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Excellence (Ihsan) in All Things</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Allah has prescribed Ihsan (proficiency/excellence) in all things."</p>
      <p>Even in slaughtering an animal for food, one must sharpen the blade and spare the animal suffering. This principle applies to worship, work, and interactions with people and animals.</p>
    `,
    18: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Taqwa and Good Character</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Fear Allah wherever you are, follow up a bad deed with a good deed which will wipe it out, and behave well towards the people."</p>
      <p>This covers the three relationships: with Allah (Taqwa), with oneself (purification after sin), and with others (good manners).</p>
    `,
    19: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Reliance on Allah (Tawakkul)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Be mindful of Allah, and He will protect you."</p>
      <p>This advice to Ibn Abbas (RA) teaches that victory comes with patience. Know that if the whole world gathered to harm you, they could not unless Allah decreed it. The pens have lifted and the pages have dried.</p>
    `,
    20: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Haya (Modesty)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"If you feel no shame, then do as you wish."</p>
      <p>This can be understood as a threat (i.e., you will be punished) or a description (i.e., what stops people from sin is shame; without it, they do anything). Haya is a branch of faith.</p>
    `,
    21: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Istiqamah (Steadfastness)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Say: I believe in Allah, then be steadfast."</p>
      <p>Istiqamah is the hardest command. It means consistent obedience to Allah until death. It requires balancing hope and fear and staying on the Straight Path without deviation.</p>
    `,
    22: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Path to Paradise</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">A man asked if praying the five prayers, fasting Ramadan, and distinguishing Halal/Haram would get him into Jannah. The Prophet (SAW) said yes.</p>
      <p>This proves that fulfilling the obligatory duties (Fara'id) is the key to salvation. Voluntary deeds (Nafl) add rank, but obligations are the foundation.</p>
    `,
    23: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Comprehensive Virtues</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Purification is half of faith. Alhamdulillah fills the scales..."</p>
      <p>This hadith lists immense rewards: SubhanAllah and Alhamdulillah fill the heavens and earth. Prayer is a light (Nur), charity is a proof (Burhan), and patience is a burning light (Diya). The Quran is either an argument for you or against you.</p>
    `,
    24: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Prohibition of Oppression (Zulm)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">A Hadith Qudsi where Allah says: "O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another."</p>
      <p>It emphasizes our total dependence on Allah for guidance, food, and forgiveness. Our worship does not benefit Him, nor do our sins harm Him.</p>
    `,
    25: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Charity in Every Action</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The poor companions complained the rich took all rewards. The Prophet (SAW) taught that every Tasbih, Takbir, and Tahmid is charity.</p>
      <p>Even enjoining good, forbidding evil, or intimacy with one's spouse is charity. It broadens the concept of Sadaqah beyond money.</p>
    `,
    26: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Gratitude for the Body</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Every day the sun rises, charity is due on every joint of the body (360 joints) as gratitude.</p>
      <p>Helping someone, saying a good word, or stepping to prayer counts. Two Rak'ahs of Duha prayer suffice for all this.</p>
    `,
    27: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Righteousness and Sin</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Righteousness is good character. Sin is what wavers in your soul and you dislike people finding out about."</p>
      <p>The heart of a believer is a moral compass. If a fatwa is given but your heart feels uneasy, it may be a sign of sin (for the righteous heart).</p>
    `,
    28: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Adhering to the Sunnah</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The Prophet (SAW) gave a farewell sermon warning against innovations (Bid'ah). "Hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs."</p>
      <p>He predicted division in the Ummah. The safety lies in following the original path of the Prophet and his companions.</p>
    `,
    29: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Gateways to Goodness</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Muadh (RA) asked for an action to enter Jannah. The Prophet (SAW) mentioned the Pillars, then voluntary deeds (Night prayer, Charity), then "Restraining the tongue."</p>
      <p>He held his tongue and said, "Does anything topple people into the Fire on their faces like the harvests of their tongues?"</p>
    `,
    30: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Limits of Allah</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Allah has set limits, so do not transgress them."</p>
      <p>What Allah is silent about is a mercy/concession, not forgetfulness, so do not probe into it (over-questioning). Respect the boundaries (Hudud).</p>
    `,
    31: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Reality of Zuhd (Asceticism)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Renounce the world and Allah will love you. Renounce what people possess and people will love you."</p>
      <p>Zuhd is not poverty; it is detachment. Money should be in your hand, not your heart. Not coveting what others have preserves dignity and brotherhood.</p>
    `,
    32: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">No Harm (La Darar)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm."</p>
      <p>This is a major Fiqh maxim. One cannot initiate harm, nor can one respond to harm with more harm (revenge that exceeds justice). It is the basis for many laws preventing damage to neighbors or society.</p>
    `,
    33: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Burden of Proof</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"If people were given according to their claims, men would claim the blood and wealth of others. But the burden of proof is on the claimant, and the oath is on the one who denies."</p>
      <p>This establishes the foundation of Islamic judicial law.</p>
    `,
    34: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Changing Evil</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Whoever sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; if unable, with his tongue; if unable, with his heart (hating it), and that is the weakest of faith."</p>
      <p>Correcting wrong is a communal obligation, scaled by one's ability and authority.</p>
    `,
    35: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Brotherhood</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Do not envy, do not outbid (to raise prices), do not hate... Be servants of Allah, brothers."</p>
      <p>A Muslim is a brother to a Muslim. He does not oppress, forsake, or despise him. Taqwa is here (pointing to the chest).</p>
    `,
    36: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Helping Others & Seeking Knowledge</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Whoever relieves a believer of distress in this world, Allah relieves him of distress on the Day of Judgment."</p>
      <p>It also praises seeking knowledge: "Whoever follows a path to knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him."</p>
    `,
    37: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Allah's Grace in Recording Deeds</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Allah has written down good and bad deeds. If one intends a good deed but doesn't do it, it's recorded as one full good deed. If he does it, it's 10 to 700 times.</p>
      <p>If one intends a bad deed but refrains for Allah's sake, it's a full good deed. If he does it, it's only one bad deed.</p>
    `,
    38: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Wali (Friend) of Allah</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Hadith Qudsi: "Whoever shows enmity to a Wali of Mine, I declare war on him."</p>
      <p>The way to become a Wali is first through obligatory duties (Fara'id), then voluntary ones (Nawafil). When Allah loves a servant, He guides his hearing, sight, and actions.</p>
    `,
    39: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Mistakes and Forgetfulness</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Allah has pardoned for me my people for their mistakes, forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do."</p>
      <p>This is a huge mercy. Intentional sin is punished, but genuine error or coercion is forgiven.</p>
    `,
    40: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Be Like a Stranger</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a traveler."</p>
      <p>Ibn Umar used to say: "If you survive till evening, do not expect the morning..." Do not get too attached to this temporary abode; prepare for the permanent home.</p>
    `,
    41: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Submitting Desires</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"None of you believes until his desire follows what I have brought."</p>
      <p>(Note: Some scholars classify this weak, but the meaning is sound). True faith is molding one's likes and dislikes to the Shariah, not bending Shariah to one's desires.</p>
    `,
    42: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Expansive Forgiveness</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Hadith Qudsi: "O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind."</p>
      <p>"If you came to me with sins filling the earth, but met Me associating nothing with Me, I would come to you with forgiveness filling the earth." The key condition is Tawheed (Monotheism).</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Importance of Intention (Niyyah)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This is the first hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, emphasizing that intention is the foundation of all deeds in Islam.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Context:</strong> Imam Bukhari started his book with this hadith to remind the seeker of knowledge to purify their intention for Allah alone.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>The validity of any deed depends on the intention behind it.</li>

      <p class="mb-2">Aisha (RA) narrates how the Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet (SAW).</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Two main forms mentioned:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Ringing of a Bell:</strong> The hardest form for the Prophet (SAW). He would sweat profusely even on cold days as the heavy message was impressed upon his heart.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel in Human Form:</strong> The angel (Jibreel) would appear as a man (often resembling Dihya al-Kalbi) and speak to him. This was easier for him to grasp.</li>

    3: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Beginning of Prophethood</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This famous hadith details the first encounter in the Cave of Hira.</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Solitude (Tahannuth):</strong> The Prophet (SAW) sought seclusion to worship before revelation.</li>
        <li><strong>"Iqra" (Read):</strong> Jibreel squeezed him three times, teaching that knowledge comes with effort and divine aid.</li>
        <li><strong>Fear & Comfort:</strong> He returned trembling to Khadija (RA), who comforted him with her famous words: "Allah will never disgrace you. You unite uterine relations, bear the burden of the weak, and help the poor."</li>
        <li><strong>Waraqa bin Nawfal:</strong> The Christian scholar confirmed this was the Namus (Angel) of Moses and predicted the Prophet's expulsion by his people.</li>

    4: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Pause in Revelation (Fatrah al-Wahi)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">After the first revelation, there was a pause (Fatrah) causing the Prophet (SAW) distress. Then Jibreel appeared on a throne between heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>The revelation of Surah Al-Muddathir ("O you wrapped up...") marked the beginning of his mission to <em>warn</em> and preach publicly, whereas "Iqra" was his commissioning as a Prophet.</p>
    `,
    5: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Listening to Revelation</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The Prophet (SAW) used to rush to repeat the verses after Jibreel out of fear of forgetting them.</p>
      <p><strong>Allah's Guarantee:</strong> Allah revealed Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-19), assuring him that He (Allah) is responsible for collecting it in his heart and enabling him to recite it. This teaches patience and trust in learning.</p>

    6: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Generosity of the Prophet (SAW)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Ibn Abbas (RA) describes the Prophet (SAW) as the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous during Ramadan when Jibreel met him.</p>
      <p><strong>Lessons:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Increasing good deeds and charity in Ramadan.</li>
        <li>Reviewing the Quran with a teacher/companion in Ramadan (Jibreel used to review it with him).</li>
        <li>His generosity was faster than the "free blowing wind" (reaching everyone).</li>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Heraclius and Abu Sufyan</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This is a long, profound hadith where the Roman Emperor Heraclius questions Abu Sufyan (who was then an enemy of Islam) about the Prophet's character.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Signs of Prophethood Identified by Heraclius:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>He is from a noble lineage.</li>
        <li>His followers are the poor and weak (initially).</li>
        <li>His followers do not apostate out of hate for the religion.</li>
        <li>He never breaks his promises.</li>
        <li>He commands prayer, truthfulness, chastity, and keeping family ties.</li>
      </ul>

    8: `
      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Faith Includes Deeds</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Faith (Iman) consists of sixty-odd branches. The highest is 'La ilaha illallah' and the lowest is removing a harmful object from the road. Modesty is a branch of Faith."</p>
      <p>This refutes those who say faith is only in the heart. It includes speech (Shahada) and physical actions (removing harm).</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Definition of a Muslim</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"A Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hands the Muslims are safe; and a Muhajir (Emigrant) is the one who leaves what Allah has forbidden."</p>
      <p>True Islam manifests in social safety. If your neighbors and community are not safe from your verbal abuse or physical harm, your Islam is deficient.</p>

      <p class="mb-2">A man asked, "Which Islam is best?" The Prophet (SAW) said: "To feed the poor and to greet those you know and those you do not know."</p>
      <p>These two acts build social cohesion and remove arrogance and enmity from the heart.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Narrating from Trustworthy Sources</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Imam Muslim begins his Sahih with an introduction emphasizing the obligation to narrate only from reliable (Thiqat) transmitters.</p>
      <p>He quotes Muhammad bin Sirin: "This knowledge is religion, so look to whom you take your religion from."</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Prohibition of Narrating from the Weak</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">It is forbidden to narrate from those known for lying, poor memory, or innovation, without clarifying their weakness. The preservation of the Sunnah depends on this scrutiny.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Warning Against Fabricating Hadith</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">The Prophet (SAW) said: "Whoever intends to lie upon me, then let him take his seat in the Fire."</p>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Lying about the Prophet is not like lying about an ordinary person; it corrupts the Deen.</li>
        <li>This threat protects the authenticity of Islam. It is why scholars developed the science of Hadith verification.</li>
        <li>Anas (RA) was hesitant to narrate too many hadiths for fear of making a mistake and falling under this warning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Intentional Lies</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">Similar to the previous narration, this emphasizes that the lie must be "intentional" (Muta'ammidan) to incur the guaranteed punishment of Hellfire.</p>
      <p>However, scholars say one must still be extremely careful not to narrate unverified reports to avoid accidental falsehoods.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Consequence of False Narrations</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Whoever narrates a hadith from me thinking it is false, he is one of the liars."</p>
      <p>This hadith makes the transmitter complicit in the lie if they suspect it is fabricated but share it anyway without warning. This is a severe warning for those who share unverified messages on social media.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Religion is Sincerity</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"The Deen is Naseehah (Sincerity/Good Advice)."</p>
      <p>This is a pivotal hadith. The entire religion boils down to wanting good for Allah, His Book, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims, and their common folk.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Islam, Iman, and Ihsan</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">This is the Muslim version of the Hadith of Jibreel. It defines the framework of the religion.</p>
      <p><strong>Ihsan:</strong> "To worship Allah as if you see Him." This level of spiritual excellence is the goal of every believer.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">The Five Pillars</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"Islam is built on five." This narration confirms the structural necessity of the five pillars: Shahada, Prayer, Zakah, Hajj, and Fasting.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Sanctity of Life and Property</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah..."</p>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> This applies to the pagan Arabs who broke treaties and fought the Prophet. It establishes that accepting Islam guarantees the safety of one's life and property in the Islamic state. It does not mean fighting peaceful people.</p>

      <h4 class="font-bold text-emerald-800 mb-2">Loving the Prophet (SAW)</h4>
      <p class="mb-2">"None of you believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his children, and all mankind."</p>
      <p>Love here means preferring the Prophet's command over one's own desires and the desires of family. It is a love of respect, obedience, and following.</p>

      <p>This emphasizes the mother's immense status due to the hardship of pregnancy, birth, and nursing.</p>
