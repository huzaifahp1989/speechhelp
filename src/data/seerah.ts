          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Noble Lineage</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">The lineage of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is the most noble of lineages, tracing back to Ismail (Ishmael), the son of Ibrahim (Abraham) (AS). He is Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Manaf bin Qusai bin Kilab... tracing back to Adnan, who is from the descendants of Ismail (AS).</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Tribe of Quraysh</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">The Prophet (SAW) belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. The Quraysh were the custodians of the Kaaba and held immense prestige in Arabia. His grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, was the chieftain of Makkah and was respected for his wisdom and generosity. The rediscovery of the Zamzam well by Abdul-Muttalib further elevated his status.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Vow of Abdul-Muttalib</h3>
          <p>Abdul-Muttalib had vowed that if he were blessed with ten sons, he would sacrifice one of them at the Kaaba. When he was blessed with ten sons, the lot fell upon Abdullah, the Prophet's father. However, the Quraysh advised him to ransom Abdullah with camels. The ransom was settled at 100 camels, saving Abdullah's life, a foreshadowing of the immense value of the life that would spring from him.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">In the year 570 CE, known as the Year of the Elephant (Am al-Fil), Abraha al-Ashram, the Abyssinian viceroy of Yemen, marched upon Makkah with a vast army and elephants, intending to destroy the Kaaba. He wanted to divert the Arab pilgrimage to a cathedral he had built in Sana'a.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Divine Intervention</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">The Makkans, led by Abdul-Muttalib, took refuge in the mountains, unable to fight the massive army. Abdul-Muttalib famously said to Abraha, "I am the lord of the camels, but the House (Kaaba) has a Lord who will protect it." As the army approached, the elephants refused to advance towards the Kaaba.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Birds of Ababil</h3>
          <p>Allah sent flocks of birds (Ababil), carrying stones of baked clay. They pelted the army, decimating them like "eaten straw" (Surah Al-Fil). This miraculous event preserved the sanctity of Makkah and set the stage for the birth of the Prophet (SAW) in the same year.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Blessed Birth</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was born on a Monday in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal (widely cited as the 12th), in the Year of the Elephant (570 CE). His father, Abdullah, had passed away while on a trade journey to Madinah (then Yathrib) before his birth. Thus, he was born an orphan.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Nursing in the Desert</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">It was the custom of the noble families of Makkah to send their infants to the desert to be nursed by Bedouin women, to acquire the pure Arabic dialect and grow up in the healthy desert air. Halimah As-Sa'diyah was the fortunate wet nurse who took him. Her household was blessed with abundance from the moment he entered it.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Splitting of the Chest</h3>
          <p>While living with Halimah, the event of Shaqq-e-Sadr (Splitting of the Chest) occurred. Jibreel (AS) came, opened his chest, removed a black clot (the portion of Satan), washed his heart with Zamzam water in a gold basin, and returned it. This was a spiritual purification preparing him for Prophethood.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">At age six, his mother Aminah took him to Yathrib to visit his father's grave and her relatives. On the return journey, she fell ill and passed away at Abwa. He was brought back to Makkah by his nurse, Umm Ayman. His grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, then took him under his loving care. But two years later, when the Prophet was eight, Abdul-Muttalib also passed away.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Under the Care of Abu Talib</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Before his death, Abdul-Muttalib entrusted his grandson to his son, Abu Talib. Abu Talib loved him more than his own children and never let him sleep apart from him. He protected him fiercely for over forty years.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Monk Bahira</h3>
          <p>At age twelve, he accompanied Abu Talib on a trade journey to Syria. At Busra, a Christian monk named Bahira noticed a cloud shading the caravan and trees bowing to the Prophet (SAW). Checking his physical signs, Bahira recognized him as the foretold Prophet and advised Abu Talib to take him back to Makkah to protect him from potential enemies.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">As he grew up, the Prophet (SAW) was known for his impeccable character. He never partook in the idol worship or vices of the Jahiliyyah (Days of Ignorance). He was known as Al-Amin (The Trustworthy) and As-Sadiq (The Truthful).</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Trade for Khadijah (RA)</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (RA), a wealthy and noble businesswoman, heard of his honesty and hired him to lead her trade caravan to Syria. He returned with substantial profits. Her servant, Maysarah, reported his noble conduct and the miraculous shading by clouds.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Blessed Union</h3>
          <p>Impressed by his character, Khadijah (RA) proposed marriage through a friend. He accepted, and the marriage took place. He was 25 and she was 40 (according to most narrations). It was a marriage of profound love and support. She was the first to believe in him and supported him with her wealth and comfort.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">Approaching the age of 40, the Prophet (SAW) began to love seclusion. He would retreat to the Cave of Hira on Jabl al-Nur (Mountain of Light) for days, contemplating the universe and worshipping the One God of Ibrahim (AS).</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Read!</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">In Ramadan, 610 CE, Jibreel (AS) appeared to him in the cave and commanded, "Iqra" (Read!). The Prophet replied, "I cannot read." This happened three times, with Jibreel squeezing him tight each time. Finally, Jibreel revealed the first verses of Surah Al-Alaq: "Read in the name of your Lord who created..."</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Comfort from Khadijah (RA)</h3>
          <p>Trembling with fear, he rushed home to Khadijah (RA) saying, "Cover me! Cover me!" She comforted him with the famous words: "By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You uphold the ties of kinship, speak the truth, help the poor and destitute, serve your guests generously and assist those who are stricken by calamity." She took him to her cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal, who confirmed his Prophethood.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Private Call</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">For the first three years, the Da'wah (call to Islam) was private. The first to believe were Khadijah (RA) (women), Abu Bakr (RA) (men), Ali (RA) (children), and Zayd bin Harithah (freed slaves). The early Muslims met secretly in the house of Al-Arqam.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Mount Safa Warning</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">When the command "Warn your nearest kinsfolk" was revealed, the Prophet (SAW) climbed Mount Safa and called out to the clans of Quraysh. He asked if they would believe him if he said an army was behind the mountain. They said yes. He then warned them of a severe punishment if they did not worship One God. Abu Lahab, his uncle, cursed him, leading to the revelation of Surah Al-Masad.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Persecution Begins</h3>
          <p>As the message spread, Quraysh began to persecute the vulnerable Muslims. Bilal (RA) was dragged on burning sand; the family of Yasir was tortured, with Sumayyah (RA) becoming the first martyr of Islam. The Prophet (SAW) was mocked, slandered as a sorcerer or madman, and physically assaulted while praying.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">Seeing the suffering of his companions, the Prophet (SAW) advised them to migrate to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), ruled by a just Christian King, Ashamah the Negus (Najashi), where "no one is wronged."</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Ja'far's Speech</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Quraysh sent envoys to demand their return. Ja'far bin Abi Talib (RA) spoke eloquently to the King, describing their former ignorance and the enlightening message of Islam. He recited verses from Surah Maryam about Mary and Jesus (AS). The King wept and refused to hand them over.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Boycott of Banu Hashim</h3>
          <p>Frustrated, Quraysh imposed a total social and economic boycott on Banu Hashim. For three years, the Prophet (SAW) and his clan lived in Shi'b Abi Talib, suffering from starvation until the boycott was ended by fair-minded leaders of Quraysh and a miracle where termites ate the boycott document.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">In the 10th year of Prophethood, Abu Talib passed away, leaving the Prophet (SAW) without his tribal protection. Shortly after, his beloved wife Khadijah (RA) also died. This double tragedy struck him deeply.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Journey to Ta'if</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Seeking a new base for Islam, the Prophet (SAW) traveled to Ta'if. The leaders there rejected him cruelly, sending street urchins to stone him until his shoes were filled with blood. He took shelter in a garden and made a heartfelt du'a to Allah complaining of his weakness.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Angel of Mountains</h3>
          <p>The Angel of Mountains appeared, offering to crush Ta'if between two mountains. The Prophet (SAW), the Mercy to the Worlds, refused, saying, "I hope that Allah will bring forth from their loins those who will worship Allah alone."</p>

          <p class="mb-4">To comfort the Prophet (SAW) after the Year of Sorrow, Allah blessed him with Al-Isra wal-Mi'raj. He was transported by the Buraq from the Sacred Mosque in Makkah to the Farthest Mosque (Al-Aqsa) in Jerusalem, where he led all the Prophets in prayer.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Ascension</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">He then ascended through the seven heavens, meeting Prophets like Adam, Isa, Yusuf, Idris, Harun, Musa, and Ibrahim (AS). He reached Sidrat al-Muntaha (The Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary) and spoke directly to Allah.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Gift of Salah</h3>
          <p>During this journey, the five daily prayers were ordained (initially 50, reduced to 5 but with the reward of 50). This event proved his high status and the importance of Salah as the believer's ascension.</p>
